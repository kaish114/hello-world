Aishwarya is a mathematics student at the Department of Mathematics and Computing, California.
 Her teacher recently gave her an intriguing assignment with only a single question.
 The question was to find out the minimum number of single digit prime numbers which when summed equals a given number X.

Input:
The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a single integer X.

Output:
Print the minimum number required. If it is not possible to obtain X using single digit prime numbers, output -1.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=X<=10^6

SAMPLE INPUT 
4
7
10
14
11
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
1
2
2
3
Explanation
10 can be represented as 7 + 3.

14 can be represented as 7+7

11 can be represented as 5+3+3.
